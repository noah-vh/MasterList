# Core Concepts

## The Philosophy: Your External Brain

**Your brain is for having ideas, not holding them.**

Master List transforms scattered thoughts into organized action by creating a single, central "life database" where everything is captured, tagged, and surfaced exactly when you need it. The result: reduced anxiety, lower cognitive load, and the confidence that nothing important will slip through the cracks.

This philosophy aligns with David Allen's Getting Things Done (GTD) method, but with a modern, AI-powered twist that eliminates the manual processing overhead.

## The Two-Phase Approach

### Phase 1: Capture First, Sort Later

- **The Inbox is sacred** - When any thought arrives ("Buy milk," "Email client," "App idea"), throw it into your Inbox immediately
- Don't stop to organize or add details in the moment
- Processing happens automatically via AI, or later during your review

### Phase 2: Process & Tag

During capture or review, metadata is added that makes the magic happen:
- AI automatically extracts metadata from natural language
- You can manually refine or adjust any field
- The system learns your patterns over time

## Task Anatomy: The Metadata Structure

Every item in your system has the following attributes. You don't need all of them for every task, but they must exist in your structure.

### A. Area (Life Domains)

The highest-level buckets that divide your life:

- **Professional** - Career, business, freelance work
- **Personal** - Health, hobbies, self-development, admin
- **Domestic** - Housework, chores, home maintenance
- **Social** - Friends, family, events, relationships

### B. Type (Nature of Item)

Not everything is equally actionable:

- **Task** - Single action step (e.g., "Call dentist")
- **Project** - Goal requiring multiple steps (e.g., "Plan birthday party")
- **Idea/Reference** - Not actionable yet (e.g., "Book concept," "Movie recommendation")

### C. Context (The Filter Keys)

These tags enable you to batch similar work and match tasks to your current state:

#### Energy Level

- 🟢 **Low Energy** - Tired, post-work, need easy wins
- 🟡 **Medium Energy** - Normal state, moderate focus required
- 🔴 **High Focus** - Deep work, peak hours, complex tasks

#### Time Estimate

- 5 min
- 30 min
- 1 hr+

#### Location

- @Home
- @Office
- @Computer
- @Errands/Out

#### Deadlines

- **Due Date** - Hard deadline (external commitment)
- **Do Date** - When you plan to do it (internal planning)

## The Views: How You Actually Use It

Instead of confronting a paralyzing list of 500 items, you create specific "views" or dashboards that show you exactly what's relevant right now.

### View A: Executive Mode (Daily Dashboard)

**Filter:** Due Date = Today OR Priority = High  

**Purpose:** Your morning command center - the "must-do" list  

**When to use:** First thing when you wake up

### View B: Brain Dead Mode (Low Energy)

**Filter:** Energy = Low AND Context = @Home  

**Result:** Easy wins like "Water plants," "Pay bill," "Fold laundry"  

**When to use:** When you're exhausted but still want to be productive

### View C: Deep Work Mode

**Filter:** Area = Work AND Energy = High Focus  

**Result:** Your hardest, most important professional tasks  

**When to use:** Peak focus hours (usually morning)

### View D: Errand Runner

**Filter:** Location = @Errands/Out  

**Result:** Grocery list, post office, hardware store tasks  

**When to use:** Only when leaving the house - ensures you never forget something

### View E: The Incubator (Ideas)

**Filter:** Type = Idea/Project Idea  

**Result:** Books to read, business ideas, gift ideas  

**Purpose:** Keeps your action list clean while preserving creative sparks

## Example: Item Lifecycle

**Capture** (In the car):  

You remember the sink is leaking. Voice-to-text into Inbox: "Fix sink"

**Process** (Automatically or during review):  

AI extracts metadata:
- Area: Domestic
- Type: Task
- Energy: Medium
- Time: 30 mins
- Location: Home

**Execute** (Saturday morning):  

Open "Weekend Chores" view (Filter: Area = Domestic + Status = Not Started). See "Fix sink" and complete it.

## Why This Works

The system works because it matches tasks to your context, energy, and location - not just arbitrary dates on a calendar. You'll always know what to do next, no matter what state you're in.

Key differentiators:
- **Context-aware**: Tasks match your current situation
- **Energy-aligned**: Work matches your mental state
- **Location-specific**: See only what you can do where you are
- **Zero navigation**: One list, infinite filters
